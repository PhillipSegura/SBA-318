# SBA-318
This is a new update to my online idea to create a space for the local dance community to find dance educators within their area. This allows studios and independent educators to put their name or dance alias, age, where they are from and what style they specialize in. Through this project I created a data base with mongoose to create a userfriendly enviorment for the educators. 
attached to my comments route and model are 7 real names of world respected dance legend that reside in the Arizona community.
Feel free to enter in your own information and make up your own dance style :)
